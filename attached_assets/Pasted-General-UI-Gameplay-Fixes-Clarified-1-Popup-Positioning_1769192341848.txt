General UI & Gameplay Fixes (Clarified)


1. Popup Positioning & Anchoring (Critical UI Rule)


Problem to fix:

Protocol and Reality Mode popups are appearing offset (top/right) and can overlap the bid button.



Required behavior:

All interactive popups (Protocols, Reality Mode effects, Moment Flags, driver-specific effects):

Must be horizontally centered

Must be vertically anchored relative to the primary action button



Anchoring rules:

During active bidding:

Popup is centered directly below the Bid / Hold button

After a round is complete:

Popup is centered directly below the “Next Round” button

Popups must never overlap:

Bid / Hold button

Next Round button

Time bank display



Implementation note:

Popups should be positioned relative to the button container, not absolute screen coordinates.

2. Driver Abilities Must Trigger Independently of Bidding


Problem to fix:

Some driver abilities do not trigger if the player does not place a bid.



Required behavior:

Driver abilities:

Must trigger based on their defined condition

Must not require the player to bid unless explicitly stated

Ability triggers must be evaluated:

Even if the player:

Did not bid

Was inactive during the round

Was impacted by protocols or Reality Mode effects



Specific fixes:

Executive P:

Ability must only target players not eliminated before or during that round

Currently failing this constraint

Hotwired:

Ability is not triggering at all — ensure trigger logic is executed every round

Wandering Eye:

Random “who is holding” logic must:

Select exactly one random player

Display holding animation only on that player’s card

Not reveal others

3. Multiple Impacts on One Player (Visual Clarity Rule)


Problem to fix:

When multiple impacts affect one player, visuals are unclear or overwritten.



Required behavior:

If a player receives multiple impacts in the same round:

Each impact must be represented on the player card

Impacts must:

Stack vertically or in a row

Use distinct, consistent colors based on impact type

Time loss

Time gain

Forced action

Trophy impact

No impact should visually replace or hide another unless explicitly designed to override

4. Prepare to Bid Countdown Must Be Game Pace–Aware


Problem to fix:

Prepare-to-bid screen incorrectly shows -0.1s.



Required behavior:

The prepare-to-bid countdown:

Must be fully dynamic

Must reflect the Game Pace–specific minimum betting delay

Example:

Marathon with 4s minimum → countdown starts at 4.0

Faster Game Pace → shorter countdown

Countdown must:

Never show negative values

End exactly when bidding becomes available
