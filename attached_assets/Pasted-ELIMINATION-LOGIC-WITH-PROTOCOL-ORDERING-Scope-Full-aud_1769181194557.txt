ELIMINATION LOGIC (WITH PROTOCOL ORDERING)


Scope: Full audit and correction of elimination logic. Be strict. Elimination is determined after all protocol effects are applied, but once determined it cannot be reversed.



1. Order of Operations (Critical)


For every bid and round resolution, logic must run in this exact order:

Apply all Protocol effects that modify time bank, bid cost, penalties, or protections

Recalculate the player’s remaining time bank

Determine elimination based on the updated time bank

Lock elimination state (cannot be undone by limit breaks or other effects)



Limit breaks and abilities cannot override elimination once step 3 is reached.

2. Eliminated Player State


If a player is eliminated after protocol calculations:

Their bet button becomes disabled

They cannot bid or ready up

The round continues without waiting for them

No limit break or ability may restore eligibility in that round

3. Trophy Eligibility After Elimination


A player eliminated in a round:

Cannot win the trophy, even if they held longest earlier

This includes eliminations caused by protocol-modified time loss

Trophy must be awarded to the longest-hold player who is not eliminated

4. No-Winner Banner Rules


The No Winner state should occur only if all players are eliminated.



If:

The longest holder is eliminated

At least one non-eliminated player exists

→ Trophy goes to the next longest valid hold



No No-Winner banner in this case.

5. Time Bank Overhold Behavior


Holding longer than available time bank:

Does not remove a trophy by default

Elimination is already handled by time bank reaching zero



Exception – Mole Protocol Only

If a player runs out of time while being longest hold in Mole:

They lose 1 trophy

Trophy goes to the next longest non-eliminated player

6. Single Player Elimination Flow


In single-player mode:

If the main player is eliminated:

Skip all remaining bot-only actions

Immediately resolve the game using current state

Do not simulate rounds the player did not participate in
